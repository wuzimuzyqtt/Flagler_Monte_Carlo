This demo will allow users to input the initial investment, expected annual return, annual volatility, investment period, and the number of simulations to run. Once the user hits the "Run Simulation" button, the Monte Carlo simulation will execute, and the app will display the mean and median of the final investment values from the simulations, along with a line chart of the results.
